\chapter{Market/Industry \& Competitor Analysis}
The Member Ship company is going to provide games from its registered developers to its subscribed gamers and thus our targeted market is both the game
market and the game distribution platforms market.
\section{Market study}
The video game industry has grown really fast over the years, its market reached \SI{78.61}[\$]{B} in 2017 and is expected to be worth over \SI{90}[\$]{B} by 2020 with a growth rate of over 18\%.

\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Taken from \url{https://www.statista.com/statistics/547025/steam-game-sales-revenue.}}
\par As game industry grows there is an increasing need for online gaming platforms
where developers can distribute their games without the obstacles of intermediaries and increase their profits.
\par When taking about gaming distribution platforms Steam is the first one in this industry with an active user base (\SI{125}[]{M}) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (\SI{150}[]{M}) which make it dominates the market.
Steam's share of the market grew from \SI{3.5}[\$]{B} in 2016 to \SI{4.3}[\$]{B} in 2017 with a growth rate of about 22\% .
\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Taken from \url{https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics}.}
\par Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft are considered the best game-selling companies
which monopolize 85\% of the game global market share, while China is the
largest consumer market for these products by nearly 20\%.In the Arab world,
the Gulf Arab countries occupy the highest rates of consumption of electronic
games, especially Saudi Arabia, about 28\% of the Arab market.\footnote{According to \url{http://tiny.cc/mk3caz}.}
\par About two-thirds in Saudi Arabia and the UAE play video games (65\% and
63\%, respectively), while closer to three in ten in Qatar and Egypt do so (33\% and 29\%, respectively). Four in ten play in Lebanon, and only a quarter play video games in Tunisia.
\par Relatively few gamers play video games on a daily basis (14\%), although those
under 25 are more likely to do so (29\%).The typical (median) time gamers spend
playing video games is five hours each week.\footnote{According to \url{http://www.mideastmedia.org/survey/2014/video-games/popularity-of-video-games-and-time-spen
html}.}
\par All of these numbers indicate how strong the game-industry market is and it
gets stronger by the time working with other industries like the hardware industry
and many others, and all the signs indicate that the future for this industry will
only become better and stronger.
\par Indie games are games made by individuals developers or small studios.They grow largely over the years with the existence of new and free game engines such as unity which makes it easy for small developers to produce quality games.Our company aims at targeting this slice of developers to publish their work on the company website.
\par Steam indie games has grown and the estimated number of indie games are about \SI{22}[]{K} and with market share of about 5\% which give us an estimate of a market size with \SI{130}[]{K} unit of games and with an avg price of \SI{7}[\$]{} per each unit, the size of the targeted market is about \SI{910}[\$]{K}.

\section{Competitors Analysis}
To prove that this investment is feasible and that we have an advantage against
possible competitors threats, the 5 forces model(porters model) is applied.
\subsection{Rivilary Among Existing Firms: Medium Pressure}
In this industry Steam is the dominant but it will have a direct competition with Epic which owns many games in the market and is going to launch its own online engine which include its made games and will be welcoming for other independent publishers.
\par Other competitors in the market are Unity,Bulizard,GOG and Gamersgate but they have less effects on the industry.
\par The Arabian and Palestinian game publishing industry  almost has no competitors 
where there's no companies  specialized in supporting Arab game developers or publishing their games online or selling them.
\subsection{Threat of Substitutes: Low Pressure}
Independent publishers can publish their games to Steam and Epic.Developers and publishers pay Steam 30\% for every game sale on the platform whereas they will pay Epic Games just 12\%.
\par Arabic independent game developers find it really hard to sell or publish their games on these platforms for reasons like:
\begin{itemize}
\item There's no actual  international fan base for Arabic developed games. 
\item There is no trust in the quality of Arabic developed games and therefore no one up votes the game in these stores. 
\end{itemize}
\par Our company aims at providing a welcoming environment for developers were they can easily share their games with low revenue cuts and thus make it an advantage against going for other substitutes.
\subsection{Bargaining Power of Buyers: High Pressure}
 Video games have a very high purchases.Consumers are looking forward to play a high quality games and with low costs and thus they tend to go to big games rather than games developed by independent suppliers and these games are found on distribution like Steam,Epic and Ubisoft.
 \par Though this have a high risk on our company but a turn over on this threat would be to not only bring Arabic independent games but also to bring trending games to the company platforms along with special offers at the lowest prices possible.    
\subsection{Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Medium Pressure} 
Arabic independent developers find it hard to distribute their games to big platforms because they have to pay (relatively high) fixed costs to these companies before they even begin to get revenues from their games for instance Steam require their publishers to pay \SI{100}[\$]{} which is considered high and risky for Arabic small developers.Also, big game distribution like Steam will keep cutting a percent (around 30\%) for each payment of game developed by its customers.
\par Our company aims at incubating these small developers by putting a small and affordable costs on publishing games and get a low percent (8\%) on each sold game and thus gaining publishers loyalty and decreasing the probability of switching to another company.     
\subsection{Threats of New Entrants: Low Pressure}
Big distribution like Steam has many competitors since their suppliers are a very big company like Ubisoft,Epic and CD-Project who can at moment build their own distribution platforms.On the other hand,the Arab world is witnessing stagnation in the huge gaming industry and tends to invest in small non-risky ones and thus it has no native platforms for its publishers.
\par Thus the risk of new entrants from new Arab competitors is very low which give us a first-mover advantage toward this industry.
\section{Competitive Advantage}
There are no companies specialized in supporting Arab game developers,publishing
their games online or selling them and our company will aim at diminish such
gaps by being the first-mover toward this business in the Arab world.
\par Big platforms such as Steam doesn’t support Arab currencies and thus make
it hard for Arab to buy the product,Players in the Middle East The interest
of electronic stores in Arabic currencies in their shops so that we can buy in
our official currency without transfer fees are collected over the amount of the
game when you buy.Our company will support almost all the Arab Currencies
to diminish this gap.
\section{Future threats} 
There are threats that may face this company as it grows.The most affecting threats are the illegal distribution of the games done by hackers ,but we would note that this threat may only occur in the far future when the company has an international reputation and its games are highly requested and can be faced throw services like Denuvo.Our defensive strategy for this threat is to make deals with online services which makes the website games more secure and hard to break. 
\chapter{Marketing Plan}
Our business aims to encourage Arab game developers and give them the ability to sell their products in local and global markets  by giving them and their games the attention and customer feedback they need.
\section{Key Performance Indicators (KPI) }
\par The company focuses on the following points to measure its performance:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of times our web page is viewed and visited.
\item Number of gamers who've subscribed in our website.
\item Number of developers who've registered in our website.
\item Number of advertiser who've contracted or are considering a contract with our company to advertise on our website.
\item Number of games sold through our website.
\end{itemize}
\section{Customers Personas}
The company aims at attracting Arab game developers who make quality games and want to sell and increase their profit from them.
\par We also aim at attracting customers and investors who are interested in Arab-developed games, those customers could be local customers (from within Palestine) or international (from nearby countries such as Gulf-countries,Egypt and Tunisia).
\par We also aim at attracting a third personas which is advertisers who want to improve their businesses by targeting their ads to gamers and developers in our environment.  
\section{Marketing Objectives}
The company considers the following marketing objectives
\begin{itemize}
\item  To break even within a year and a quarter of business.
\item To dominate the Arab world game industry and become the $1^{st}$ distributor of Arab games within 5 years of time
\item To expand and start competing world-wide.
\item To have an international market share within 10-15 years of business.
\end{itemize}
\section{Marketing Mix}
In this section, we consider the 4 marketing mix to satisfy the needs and desires of consumers whether they are gamers,developers or advertisers.
\subsection{Product}
\par The quality level of products distributed by developers are important so for a game to be sold by our company and exist on our website it has to meet up with the following quality standards:
\begin{itemize}
\item The game has to work properly and reported bugs shall be solved by the developer as soon as possible. 
\item The game should be compatible with the OS's that it is developed for.
\item The game should has a content that is reasonable with its sold cost.
\item The game should meet our community standards and being suitable for the genre it's being sold or advertised for.
\end{itemize}
\par  As part of the company design and styles,game developers have to declare what language or engine is used to design their games and what  genre it's directed to.
\par The website distributed games are guaranteed to have developer support and a satisfying level of quality which enhances the company features.
\par As a branding strategy, games will have their developer logo as the game makers and our logo as the game distributors and will be registered in both our name and the developer's name.
\par The size of games distributed in the platform is not limited and depends on the game contents and technology.
\par As part of our company sale strategies,we provide our customers with fast reliable support and a new market to sell their games in and advertise their products. 
\par The company ensure a full refund on its sold games as part of its warranty for the customers and this may occur in cases like:
\begin{itemize}
\item The game didn't work due to a developer error.
\item The game was different from its description.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Pricing}
The company aims when determining prices is to make reasonable profit through the developer subscription,the small cut percentage on the sold games revenue and through payments for advertising activities. 
\par The game price elasticity is affected by the change in demand of a certain game which affect its popularity causing us to reduce its price and  make offers and deals on it.On the other hand, if the demand increases the price of the game wont change ( won't become less).
\par As a pricing method strategy,the price of games is determined by its content,how much time it took to make and the resources where used in developing it and thus any game with price that doesn't reflect its content and quality won't be distributed in our website.
\subsection{Place}
Our customers can access our services through the company website where they can subscribe and download games or distribute it or contract with the company to advertise their products.
\par The only way to get our services is through our website and this strategy is adopted to diminish costs on contracts with agents to distribute our products and to reach the largest possible segment of potential customers.
\subsection{Promotion} 
Social media has proven to be very effective in promoting products and bring in customers.This method of promotion is considered cheap and effective for start-ups and thus at the beginning,we plan to get to our customers through social media advertisement.
\par After making a name and building a reputation for the company,we plan to use Google targeted ads to advertise the website and the company to different developers,gamers and advertisers.
\chapter{Operation Plan}   
The location of the project has been chosen so that it is close to the staff and easy to reach.It has also been taken into account that the cost of rent should be as low as possible so that the impact of fixed costs is low.
\par The project is located in the center of Nablus in a small studio room with a rent,thus ensuring lower transportation costs for the staff.
\par The site is furnished and ready for use, but needs to be supplied with water, electricity and internet from the company's expenses.

\par The website also needs to be promoted and we plan to do that using social media both by putting latest products promotion in the company social pages and by taking low cost offers these social medias.
\par The project initially needs an employee who can deal with customers and support them.That the employee should be aware of the efficient methods in promoting digital products through social medias and video-sharing websites like YouTube.Also he should have the skills of fulfilling customer needed services,communicate with them and hear their complaints and suggestions through our website,social pages and official e-mails.

\chapter{Financial Statements}
In this section, we will present an estimate of the financial statements for the three years following the commencement of the project.These estimates are based on the market analysis done previously in the report and based on the customary costs in the Palestinian market.
\par The company needs a place where it can put its database servers and where the employees will meet.The rent of the small-furnished studio will have a fixed cost of \SI{1220}[\$]{K} per year, other fixed costs are the cost of the database server (\SI{700}[\$]{}) and the cost of two desktop as there will be two employees (\SI{170}[\$]{}).Also,the company is registered as a partnership company which costs \SI{130}[\$]{}.

\par The revenue drivers of the company depend on three main sources described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Subscription fees on customers who download and play the platform games this subscription will cost the customer \SI{5}[\$]{} for each month and shall be payed at the start of each month.
\item Every published game requires its developer to pay \SI{5}[\$]{} before it launches on the company platform and there's a revenue cut of 10\% on each sold game.
\item Contracts with advertisers who want to advertise their products on the company websites apps and emails,this have an average of  \SI{3}[\$]{} every month per each customer.     
\end{itemize}
\par From the revenue drivers mentioned above,the revenue of the company per each year is given by the following multivariate function:
\begin{equation}
R(P,G_{new},C_{avg},D_{avg},A)=60P+5G_{new}+0.1C_{avg}D_{avg}+36A\;\$
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{conditions}
 P     &   Number of players in this year \\
 G_{new}     &  Number of new games published on the website in this year \\   
 C_{avg} &  Average price of a game in this year \\
 D_{avg} & Average game downloaded (purchased) this year \\
 A & Number of advertisers in this year 
\end{conditions} 
\par The depreciation year for the server and the desktops is 5 years and all the tables where filled with time value of the money already discounted. 
\section{Performa Income Statement}
The performa income statement for the next three years is shown in the following table:
\input{Diagrams/PerformaIncomeTable}

\section{Breakeven Analysis}
Since the revenue from the services are given by multivariate quantities,we choose to make the breakeven analaysis by plotting the revenues and total costs as a function of time.
\par The following graph shows the breakeven point between total revenues and total costs:
\begin{figure}[H]
